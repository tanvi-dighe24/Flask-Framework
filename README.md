# Flask-Framework✅

Commonly used and popular Python Framewprk - FLASK
Lightweight, flexible, and popular open-source micro web framework written in Python, designed for building web applications and REST APIs. 
Classified as a "microframework" because it does not require specific tools or libraries (no built-in ORM or form validation), it enables developers to easily pick and use the extensions they need. 
Flask is a micro web framework powered by Python.
Its API is fairly small, making it easy to learn and simple to use. But don't let this fool you, 
as it's powerful enough to support enterprise-level applications handling large amounts of traffic. 
You can start small with an app contained entirely in one file,
then slowly scale up to multiple files and folders in a well-structured manner as your site becomes more and more complex.
