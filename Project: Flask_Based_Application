1)Create a new Python file named app.py. This file will contain the code for your first Flask web application
Code:
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()


🔺Explanation:

Flask(__name__) creates the Flask application
@app.route('/') connects the home URL (/) to a function
The function returns text shown in the browser
app.run() starts the local server

2)i)Run the Flask Application
Run the command and you will see following in your terminal..

2) ii)Run the Flask Application
Open the given URL in your web browser to view your first Flask web page showing Hello World.

3) Handling a POST Request Using an HTML Form
To understand how POST requests work in Flask, we will create a form that sends a user’s name to the server and displays it after submission.

Folder Structure

Before writing any code, organize your project folder as shown below:

FolderStructure

#App Folder Structure
#Explanation:
app.py: Main Flask application file
templates/: Flask automatically looks here for HTML files
name.html: HTML form used to send POST data

#Create the HTML Form
Inside the templates folder, create a file named name.html and add the following code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <h3>Enter Your Name</h3>
    <form method="post">
        <input type="text" name="username" required>
        <br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
</body>
</html>

#Explanation:
form uses method="post" to send data securely
input field sends the value using the name username
Clicking Submit sends the data to the Flask server

Now, Update app.py as shown below:
from flask import Flask, request, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['username']
        return f"Hello {name}, POST request received"
    return render_template('name.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
#Output
Open the browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/login
Now, Enter a name and click Submit
 browser displays: Helllo your name, POST request received!

#Explanation:
render_template() displays the HTML form
methods=['GET', 'POST'] allows both request types
GET request shows the form in the browser
POST request reads submitted form data using request.form
debug=True helps during development
